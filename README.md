Project Name & Pitch

To Do List

A to do list app using a mock API that shows overdue, pending, and completed tasks. The tasks are sorted as follows: overdue, pending, completed, and are marked as such with the background colors red, orange, and green, respectively. Overdue/Pending tasks can be updated by calling the mock API to mark task as completed. The updated task will then be sorted into the bottom of the list with other completed tasks but will not persist after browser refresh.

Notes - The current mock API only returns overdue and completed tasks, not pending.
